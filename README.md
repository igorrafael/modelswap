# modelswap
Unity tool to automate swapping models. Initial version made available for preview under the MIT license at [github.com/igorrafael/modelswap](http://github.com/igorrafael/modelswap).

This can be used "apply" different prefabs to a GameObject without aftecting parts of the hierarchy that are not present in the model.

The biggest advantage is when this is used with an external model (e.g.: fbx) that can be re-applied without losing local modifications.

Proposed features:
- Editor and Runtime support
- Preview in inspector view
- Multi-object editing support
- Nesting support
